# NoteTaker

## Description

This project utilizes Node.js, Heroku, UUIDv4.js, Express.js, and the built-in 'fs' package to create a working Express.js server for a note-taking application. It was definitely a test of my abilities to create **working** routes using Express.js. The final result is deployed on a Heroku server.
